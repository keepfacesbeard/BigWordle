# BigWordle
A bigger Wordle! Uses 7 letter words. The wordlist has been created from three separate dictionary lists (publicly available) including the scrabble dictionary. Some words were pretty strange, so I only used (as answer words) the ones that were in all three dictionaries. The valid guess words, though, are any word in any of the three dictionaries. Apologies in advance if you get a strange archaic word and lose a round, English has some oddball 7-letter words.
